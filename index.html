        God I hate deciding. Especially when it comes to food or purchases. "Should I
        have Burger King? Or should I have Taco Bell?" "Should I buy this thing now or wait until it goes on sale?" What
        if it ends up going badly? What if I regret what I chose? My point is, there are a lot of
        decisions I have to make and it would be easier if I could just farm that out to someone or something else to do
        for me. That way, I can't be held accountable for my choice, since I just did whatever someone suggested I do.

        This n-ary decision maker can choose between 2 or more decisions. Just enter the options in front of you in the
        text box, hit "add" and then start the wheel. You can pick whatever it lands on and know that it wasn't
        <i>your</i> decision, and that you aren't morally responsible for the choice, or you can be disappointed by the
        outcome and know which outcome you really want.

        Use it to decide what to have for dinner. Use it to decide if you should break up with your boyfriend. I don't
        care. Refresh the page to start over.
